  summary:
    "At the end of 2024, I decided to go all in on web development after wrapping up an internship as a Full Stack Developer. Over the years, I’ve worked on some projects like Corsa GRM for hotel departments and Arsene Project for animation web components. Gratefully, i’ve won a few competitions along the way. Currently working an exciting project called BNSP-LSP 40, that automates school and business processes. We'll see where this journey takes me next.",
