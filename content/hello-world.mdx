Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I've decided to start writing here for three main reasons:

1. **Document My Journey**: As I explore web development and build projects, I want to keep track of what I learn along the way.

2. **Share Knowledge**: Writing helps me understand concepts better, and if my posts can help someone else learn something new, that's even better.

3. **Build in Public**: I believe in learning in public. This blog will showcase my growth as a developer and the projects I'm working on.

What to expect? Posts about:
- Web development tutorials
- Project breakdowns
- Technical concepts explained simply
- Learning resources I find helpful

```jsx
const blog = {
  author: "Muhamad Pasha Albara",
  goal: "Share & Learn",
  status: "Just getting started..."
};
```

Let's learn together! ðŸš€
